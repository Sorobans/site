        <p>Groundhog Day the Musical is a stage adaptation of the 1993 film Groundhog Day. It follows Phil Connors, a narcissistic asshole weatherman who is sent to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania to report on the Groundhog Day Ceremony. He treats everybody horribly, believing the silly holiday is beneath him. However, to his surprise he wakes up the next morning to discover it is Groundhog Day... again! Phil becomes stuck in a time loop where every day is February 2nd, and as he goes from denial to exploitation to nihilism to depression to acceptance, Phil realizes that it is his actions and worldview that change the lives of the people around him and create hope for a better tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Groundhog Day explores themes of what it means to be "stuck" and how everybody has the opportunity to make the most of their life and change for the better. It also emphasizes hope for a better future, and how even if now there are six more weeks of winter... there will be sun. </p>

        <p>The shining star of Groundhog Day is truly the music. Composed by Tim Minchin, who also wrote the Matilda musical, the score is gorgeous and contains so many repeating motifs to encapsulate the time loop theme while imbuing recurring melodies with new meaning as the story unfolds. It truly is a work of genius and I'm not exaggerating (tbh I think it's better than Matilda and deserves just as much recognition if not more, but that's just my opinion).</p>

    <div class="card7">
      <p>Part of the reason that I love this show is because of its strong ensemble. The entire show is very focused on Phil and his character arc, but the moving pieces created by the rich and deliberate world of Punxsutawney's people are what give the show its punch. You see these same characters going through their same daily routine over and over again and grow to understand them as Phil does. The ensemble is so critical to the story and the show feels so deep as a result. </p>

    <h3>In conclusion...</h3>
    <p>Groundhog Day is one of my favorite musicals ever. It is funny, emotional, and just really really smartly made. It's sooooo good and I am trying to convert as many people to my cause as possible. Broadway may have hated it but they're stupid losers anyway. I hope you enjoyed and maybe are interested in checking this show out!</p>
    <p>Thanks for reading and <i>goooooo chucks!!</i></p>
