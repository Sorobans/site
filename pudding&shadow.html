              <p>Things to know about me: I play tennis - I only play for fun right now but I'd love to play semi-professionally or professionally one day. I'm super outdoorsy and I love to run, swim, and just be outdoors! I used to be a circus performer, believe it or not, and I can do a lot of aerial tricks and trapieze! Also I can kind of play the piano but I haven't practiced in a long time.</p>
              <p> I live at the Beechgrove House for Halfway Humans, which can be fun! It's like going to college without any of the classes, kind of.</p>
              <p>And before you ask, no I will not sing. I know I'm technically a siren and everybody asks about the magic singing but I DO NOT SING. So please stop asking.</p>
