      <h3>SNEETCHES IN SPACE</h3>
<p>now the star-bellied sneetches could breathe on mars</p>
<p>but the plain-bellied sneetches could not upon thars.</p>
<br></br>
<p>the plain-bellies had to pull around tanks</p>
<p>which greatly affected their social ranks,</p>
<p>for they needed the tanks to breathe air</p>
<p>but they were quite heavy, and needed great care.</p>
<br></br>
<p>the star-bellies thought that they were so great</p>
<p>and every night they would shout as they ate,</p>
<p>“ha ha, you silly old oxygen breathers,</p>
<p>we get real food, while you’re astronaut paste eaters!”</p>
<br></br>
<p>and the plain-bellies were quite tired of this,</p>
<p>and they didn’t think that the star-bellies would miss</p>
<p>if they got up and left the planet of mars</p>
<p>the planet where they could not breathe upon thars.</p>
<br></br>
<p>and so they left. they left in a hurry,</p>
<p>not thinking that the star-bellies would worry.</p>
<br></br>
<p>but the star-bellied sneetches, they worried a lot.</p>
<p>they liked the plain-bellies, though they said they did not.</p>
<br></br>
<p>the star-bellies searched and the star-bellies found</p>
<p>that the plain-belly sneetches had fled to the ground</p>
<p>that was far off in space and not upon mars</p>
<p>on a new planet where they could breathe upon thars.</p>
<br></br>
<p>and so the star-bellies traveled to earth,</p>
<p>thinking that the plain-bellies had gone there in mirth.</p>
<br></br>
<p>and the plain-bellies were there, to that we give thanks.</p>
<p>but now it’s the star-bellies who need the breathing tanks!</p>

      <h3>ALGEBRA IS HARD, YOU GUYS</h3>

<p>Some find it quite simple to understand,</p>
<p>Some lost in the sea of numbers and</p>
<p>Numerals, the grand wasteland</p>
<p>Of bland quicksand</p>
<p>Watching the clock slowly come to a stand</p>
<p>Still. I, on the other hand</p>
<br></br>
<p>Would be a member of the former</p>
<p>If not for my formidable foe:</p>
<p>Parenthesis.</p>
<p>Their necessary presence</p>
<p>Putting my patience to the</p>
<p>Test with every layer of curved</p>
<p>Containment</p>
<p>Organized at the origin of the order</p>
<p>Of operations, the principle PEMDAS</p>
<p>That pronounces a separated</p>
<p>Calculated safehouse, the sinuous</p>
<p>Symbol that sorrows my days.</p>
<p>The pain of the constant curving</p>
<p>Of my pen on the paper, never</p>
<p>Symmetrical or acceptable, an</p>
<p>Unethical unidentical assemble</p>
<p>Unfortunately parenthetical</p>
<p>Not to mention the brackets, the</p>
<p>Bane of my mathematical existence,</p>
<p>Parenthesis for parenthesis, uselessly</p>
<p>Cornered, countering the conventionality</p>
<p>An equation should bring.</p>
<br></br>
<p>In summary: fuck you, parenthesis. </p>
