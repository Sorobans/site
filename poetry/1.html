      <h3>CHALLENGER’S DEEP</h3>
<p>The boy enters the bathyscaphe that bobs along the beach.</p>
<p>He longs to try to hide away where moonbeams never reach.</p>
<p>The bite still throbs, the heart still boils, sick with lycanthropy,</p>
<p>But we know there's no werewolves at the bottom of the sea.</p>
<br></br>
<p>The space is tight, the quiet heavy, the steel sharp on skin,</p>
<p>The air is hot with panting breaths as the darkness sets in.</p>
<p>A life of seasick solitude is a small price to pay</p>
<p>To keep the beast inside of him away another day.</p>
<br></br>
<p>There are no days, or nights, or months when black is all you see,</p>
<p>So he sits in submerged silence for all eternity.</p>
<p>But soon enough, the moon appears, brilliant and full and strong.</p>
<p>Not even lonely wolves can avoid her stern gaze for long.</p>
<br></br>
<p>No light can pierce the dark abyss but still the body knows.</p>
<p>No one is around to hear the screams as the werewolf grows.</p>
<p>Later the empty bathyscaphe would wash up in the tide,</p>
<p>The steel shredded sharply by a man trying to hide</p>
<p>But the depths are no salvation from the monster inside.</p>

<p>Lover, when I speak my words are yours.</p>
<p>(Lover, when I speak my words are yours.)</p>
<br></br>
<p>The soft curve of your lip, I drink</p>
<p>your kiss but come away empty. Is love</p>
<p>so spurned?</p>
<p>You are a timid thing,</p>
<p>hiding from the raindrops. My hair is a curtain,</p>
<p>separating us from the world, an</p>
<p>undisturbed oasis. I will protect you.</p>
<p>I will endure the cold beat of</p>
<p>rain if it means I can gaze into your watery eye</p>
<p>forever, a jewel just out of reach.</p>
<p>I will grow roots.</p>
<p>My spine will curve, a stem reaching</p>
<p>toward its sustenance, my head bowed</p>
<p>in worship of my lifegiving sun.</p>
<p>I could sit here until the end of days for staying is knowing you will never leave.</p>
<p>(I could sit here until the end of days for staying is knowing you will never leave.)</p>
<br></br>
<p>This riverbank an overlook (Look) into my portrait of desire,</p>
<p>the clouds up (up,) above your head</p>
<p>swirl in the breeze, your image splits (it's) apart.</p>
<p>Stormy (me,) lover,</p>
<p>you're (your) fleeting, but still I skim the</p>
<p>mirror surface, trying to hold the echo (Echo.)</p>
<p>of myself, my only.</p>
